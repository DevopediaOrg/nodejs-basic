# 0. Overview

This is a sample project for beginners who wish to learn Node.js. We will build a small web app. To learn the concepts step by step, we suggest you clone this code repository and checkout relevant checkpoints identified by branch names.

To start learning, you will need to install some essential tools. Versions mentioned below were used on Windows 10 when preparing this project but you may use more recent versions. Install the following:
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/download) (2.19.1): Used to clone repo and checkout code of a specific branch.
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (10.13.0 LTS): JavaScript runtime to run Node.js apps.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (6.4.1): Used To install and manage node modules. This is automatically installed as part of Node installation.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (1.28.2): Any code editor or IDE would do but we'll use Visual Studio Code for this project. 

To validate that correct versions are installed, you can type the following commands on a terminal:
```
git --version
node -v
npm -v
code -v
```

To get a high-level overview of Node.js, read the [Node.js](https://devopedia.org/node-js) article on Devopedia.

The rest of this document guides you through the project step by step. To try out code at a particular step, checkout the relevant branch. For example, to checkout code of `br0.1` branch, run command `git checkout br0.1`. Branch names are mentioned in section headers. With the command `git branch -a` you can list all branches.


# 1. Hello World (br0.1)

Execute this command: `node hello.js`

This doesn't do anything useful except print out a string and exit. While Node usually is an app server listening for client requests, it can also be used to build a standalone program that does something specific and exits normally.

The file `hello.js` has a single line of code. Small code snippets can be executed directly on the command line using the `-e` option: `node -e "console.log('Hello World!')"`

Official documentation explains all the [command-line options](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#cli_command_line_options).

The same single line code can be executed within the developer console of a web browser. Like a web browser, Node.js provides a JavaScript runtime but for server-side execution.


# 2. A Hello World Server (br0.2)

Execute this command: `node server.js`. Access the URL `http://localhost:8888` from your browser. Congrats! You now have a Node-based web app running!

Open the file `server.js` in VS Code. It's important to follow style conventions and use a suitable linting tool to catch errors early. [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) is a popular resource. ESLint is a useful tool for linting. ESLint is already configured in file `.eslintrc.js`. To install ESLint for our project, execute this command `npm install`. You will now notice that VS Code will highlight syntax/style errors (if any).

It's a good time to get familiar with Node.js documentation. Read about the following API calls that we've used in `server.js`:
* [http.createServer()](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_createserver_options_requestlistener)
* [server.listen()](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_server_listen)

It will be apparent from the documentation that callback functions are the last argument. This is the convention in Node.

Here are a couple of questions to think about (for JS beginners):
* Why is "Server running ..." printed only once on the console?
* Why is "Request received ..." printed with every client request?


# 3. Server as a Module (br0.3)

We'll refactor the code to make the design more modular. Server code is made into a module. The app's entry point is `index.js`. Thus, we can start it by running `node index.js`

Try out the following URLs in browser: `http://localhost:8888` and `http://localhost:8888?username=Johnny`

In `server.js`, since the request callback is likely to get more complex, we give it a name `onRequest()` and then pass it to the server. We use `url` module to extract parts of the query string. This is a legacy module: there's also `URL` class as an alternative. See [URL API docs](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html) for more information.

What happens if the request is `http://localhost:8888?username=Johnny&username=Kate`? Does the response make sense?

This may also be a good time to try out debugging the code in VS Code. There's already a debugging configuration in file `.vscode/launch.json` that you can use.


# 4. Setting up the Router (br0.4)

We have two new files:
* `router.js`: This routes requests to different callbacks.
* `requestHandlers.js`: This encapsulates all the request callbacks.

In file `index.js` we map URL paths to their callbacks within a single handler object. Also, we pass both the router and handler to the server. Instead of hard-coding these into the server, we pass them as arguments to the server. In other words, the server is loosely coupled from both the router and the handler. This concept is called [Dependency Injection](https://devopedia.org/dependency-injection).

The router takes the handler and the request as arguments. In fact, router doesn't need the entire request. It needs only the URL path. But the handlers might require the entire request object and hence we pass it along. 

Do the following:
* Open `http://localhost:8888/list` in a browser tab (don't wait for response)
* Open `http://localhost:8888` in another browser tab

Note that we now return a 404 error for the `favicon.ico` file.

Study the callback code. Which one is a blocking call? Which one is a non-blocking call? Can you explain what's happening?


# 5. Passing Response Object to Request Handlers (br0.5)

Response object is passed into the request handlers. Each handler will take care of writing the response. This design allows us to handle non-blocking operations correctly. Their callbacks will have the necessary output to form the response correctly.

Note that server code is extremely simple now. Everything is handled by router and request callbacks.


# 6. Form with File Upload (br0.6)

We extend the example with a simple form. This form allows a file upload. We make use of `formidable` module. You can install it by running `npm install` since we've already recorded it as a package dependency. To learn more, visit the [Dependency Manager](https://devopedia.org/dependency-manager) article on Devopedia.

Open homepage, fill the form and submit it. No form validation is done but we will add this later. 

Let's study the code in `server.js`, where the file upload is handled. Data from the client is received by `stream.Readable` object. When a chunk of data is ready to be consumed from the stream, `data` event is emitted. When data has been fully consumed from the stream, `end` event is emitted. Read the documentation for [stream.Readable](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_readable) more information.

Why are we not getting "Receiving a chunk ..." prints on the console? What happens if you comment the `return` statement? If your POST data is large, how many chunks do you see and what's the approximate maximum size of each chunk? What happens if we handle file upload/save error by adding this line:
```
throw error;
```

What happens if we catch the above exception using a `try-catch` block in `index.js`:
```
try {
  server.start(router.route, handle);  
} catch (error) {
  console.error(error);
}
```

In general, throwing exceptions to the event loop is not recommended. Errors that happen within asynchronous callbacks cannot be thrown and caught in a synchronous way. Learn more about [uncaught exceptions](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_event_uncaughtexception) in the documentation. Instead, use the `On Error Resume Next` pattern.

Instead of throwing the error, what happens if we do this (keep the `return` statement commented):
```
if (error) {
  console.log(error.message);
  return;
}
```

If you prefer a more modern syntax, the `request.addListener()` code in `server.js` can be rewritten as follows:
```
request
  .on('data', (chunk) => postData += chunk)
  .on('end', () => route(handle, request, response, postData));
```

](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/).


# 7. Refactor File Upload Code & Input Validation (br0.7)

We refactor the code so that file upload is now done inside the handler. We remove some redundant code used earlier just for learning purpose. We no longer need `postData` variable. We send back the response after the form is fully received but before the uploaded file is renamed.

We do input validation on the form at server side. For this purpose we use `node-input-validator` module. Install it as usual by executing `npm install`. Study the [documentation of node-input-validator](https://github.com/artisangang/node-input-validator). Notice how we reuse code in `getFormBody()`.
